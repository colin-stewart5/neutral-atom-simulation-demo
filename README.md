# neutral-atom-simulation-demo

The goal of this project is to show a minimal example of time-dependent quantum dynamics for an open neutral atom qubit system.

The main goals of this repo are:
- Using python packages related to quantum mechanics
- Clean software structure
- Simulation of a time-dependent open quantum system

This code is NOT a full implementation of my research but rather a small demonstration of common techniques and software practices used.

Features:
- 2 qubit neutral atom Hamiltonian
- Collapse operators
- Time-dependent Rabi drive
